        <p>In a world where innovations appear daily and everything changes very quickly and globally, it becomes even more necessary to implement projects that increase value in a shorter period of time and with a higher success rate.</p>
        <p>Faced with a more demanding reality, companies and organizations began to seek more efficient methods and processes to implement projects more intelligently. Ensuring, therefore, that the objective is met according to the stipulated period and the pre-defined goals.</p>
        <p>The more traditional models, including the well-known <b>waterfall</b>, which have, generally, longer processes and have final objectives that are very rigid and not very adaptable, proved to be unfeasible for the implementation of many types of projects.</p>
        <p>In this way, the use of <b>SCRUM</b> in many projects that have adopted this framework in recent years has shown, in an easier way, the identification of failures and the completion of complex projects in a shorter period of time and with a lower economic cost.</p>

        <h2>Sentinel Before SCRUM</h2>
        <p>The FBI's Sentinel project provides us with a great case study of how different approaches to developing software can yield different results. This case makes visible how a good approach can save any company or organization money.</p>
        <p>In 2001 began the first FBI's attempt to move to an electronic case management system with the Virtual Case File (VCF) project.</p>
        <p>The VCF project was abandoned in 2005 after spending $170 million.</p>
        <p>According to experts, the project did not meet the defined minimum requirements that were laid out at the beginning</p>
        <p>So the FBI decided to hire a company to develop this project, adding new requirements and experimented with the pre-planned development on the new contractor.</p>
        <p>In March 2006, development of Sentinel by Lockheed Martin for US$425 million was announced. That also failed. In 2010, the FBI announced that they would no longer work with Lockheed Martin and would finalize the remaining two phases of the project using Agile methodology development strategy.</p>

        <h2>Sentinel After SCRUM and the New Approach</h2>
        <p>So the new Information's Director decided to change Sentinel's approach. This would streamline decision-making processes and allow the FBI to deliver Sentinel.</p>
        <p>In 2011, a Sentinel test exercise was performed and many deficiencies were found in the project, including performance and system architecture.</p>
        <p>The FBI told the Justice Department's Inspector General that it believed it could complete Sentinel with the remaining budget and within 12 months.</p>
        <p>An audit had already concluded that the FBI would have needed an additional $35 million and another six years if it had continued with the traditional methodology.</p>
        <p>The Sentinel's staff was reduced from 400 to 45 people, 15 of whom were programmers. The CTO did the project himself, with the goal of delivering new Sentinel functionality every 30 days. Each new feature needed to meet all final requirements.</p>
        <p>Every three months, the FBI would implement the features that had been built in the preceding three iterations in a field pilot.</p>
        <p>In November 2011, after a year of restarting the project with Scrum, all phases of Sentinel were completed.</p>
        <p>The software was implemented in a pilot group of FBI offices. The remaining executives had implementation by June 2012. The FBI completed Sentinel for $30 million in 12 months, a savings of over 90%.</p>
        <p>After the FBI changed its approach, adopting Scrum as a Digital Transformation tool, they worked with the same intensity as before, but were rewarded with far superior results.</p>
