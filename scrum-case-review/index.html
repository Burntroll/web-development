        <p>In a world where innovations appear daily and everything changes very quickly and globally, it becomes even more necessary to implement projects that increase value in a shorter period of time and with a higher success rate.</p>
        <p>Faced with a more demanding reality, companies and organizations began to seek more efficient methods and processes to implement projects more intelligently. Ensuring, therefore, that the objective is met according to the stipulated period and the pre-defined goals.</p>
        <p>The more traditional models, including the well-known <b>waterfall</b>, which have, generally, longer processes and have final objectives that are very rigid and not very adaptable, proved to be unfeasible for the implementation of many types of projects.</p>
        <p>In this way, the use of <b>SCRUM</b> in many projects that have adopted this framework in recent years has shown, in an easier way, the identification of failures and the completion of complex projects in a shorter period of time and with a lower economic cost.</p>

        <h2>Sentinel Before SCRUM</h2>
        <p>The FBI's Sentinel project provides us with a great case study of how different approaches to developing software can yield different results. This case makes visible how a good approach can save any company or organization money.</p>
        <p>In 2001 began the first FBI's attempt to move to an electronic case management system with the Virtual Case File (VCF) project.</p>
        <p>The VCF project was abandoned in 2005 after spending $170 million.</p>
        <p>According to experts, the project did not meet the defined minimum requirements that were laid out at the beginning</p>
        <p>So the FBI decided to hire a company to develop this project, adding new requirements and experimented with the pre-planned development on the new contractor.</p>
        <p>In March 2006, development of Sentinel by Lockheed Martin for US$425 million was announced. That also failed. In 2010, the FBI announced that they would no longer work with Lockheed Martin and would finalize the remaining two phases of the project using Agile methodology development strategy.</p>
